# cornedtea's Personal Projects
A collection of things I've worked on - either in class or on my own time - that I am either done with and proud of or working on. So far I've only taken introductory courses in RStudio and Python so nothing too high-level here yet.

## List of Projects
### Python
`braille.py` is a program that reads typed input and uses tkinter to draw what the braille transliteration of the typed input would be (based on a braille codex provided in my introductory python course - I might update for accuracy another time). I made this one just to see if I could.

`lizardSpock.py` is a suggested expansion upon `rockPaperScissors.py` that includes the version of Rock, Paper, Scissors introduced in The Big Bang Theory that has two extra teams -- Lizard and Spock. The code for team change was changed in such a way that I could probably make a program with even more teams, in the future.

`matrixDeterminant.py` is my current project. This program will as a user to input a square matrix of integers (probably with a size limit) and return the determinant using a recursive function. As of right now, it can only compute determinants of diagonal matrices.

`rockPaperScissors.py` is a program inspired by a genre of video that circulated various social media like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok in early 2023 that featured a simulation of teams of rock, paper, and scissors moving around a screen and changing teams upon collision (in accordance with established Rock, Paper, Scissors rules) until only one team remained. This program was created as my final project for an introductory Python course in collaboration with other students named in the program description.

`tidbits.py` is a collection of smaller functions I've written that are fun to play around with! The ones currently in the file are all from my introductory Python course.

`transparentBG.py` is a program that will take an image that has a grayscale background and a non-grayscale foreground and create a copy of the foreground on a transparent background. I made this because an image for the rock paper scissors program I made had a false transparent background and I didn't want to find a new image.

Note: `imageTools.py` is not mine, it contains code needed for some functions in `tidbits.py` and was provided by a professor to write those functions. Credits for its creation are in the program description.
