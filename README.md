# cornedtea's Personal Projects
A collection of things I've worked on - either in class or on my own time - that I am either done with and proud of or working on (and potentially still proud of). So far I've only taken introductory courses in RStudio and Python (1 semester each) so nothing too high-level here yet.

## List of Projects
### Python
`transparentBG.py` is a program that will take an image that has a grayscale background and a non-grayscale foreground and create a copy of the foreground on a transparent background. I made this because an image for the rock paper scissors program I made had a false transparent background and I didn't want to find a new image.

`braille.py` is a program that reads typed input and uses tkinter to draw what the braille transliteration of the typed input would be (based on a braille codex provided in my introductory python course - I might update for accuracy another time). I made this one just to see if I could.
